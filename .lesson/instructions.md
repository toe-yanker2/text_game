# Instructions
Goal: Make a text-based game.

You will write a "Choose your own Adventure" story that asks the user to make decisions that change the outcome of the story.

If you want, you can have different sections of the game. Examples:
* At the beginning of the game, you could choose your player skills, name, characteristics, or what pet or sidekick you have
* During gameplay, you could meet up with an NPC (non-playable character) and have a dialogue with them. Depending on what the player says, the NPC might give them different information, or decide to help or hinder the character
## Requirements
* At least 12 conditional blocks (if)
  * At least 6 of those conditional blocks have alternative execution (if then else)
    * At least 3 of those conditional blocks with alternative execution have complex conditional execution (if, then elif, then else)
* At least 12 requests for input from the user
  * At least 2 user inputs should be converted to numbers
  * At least 4 requests for input should include input validation
    * Check that the response from the user matches some expected set of possibilities. If the user says something unexpected, ask them to try again.
* At least 5 f-strings that use curly brackets to print out the value of a python variable or expression
## Milestones
### Proposal (Wednesday, November 1)
Update your readme to include this information:
* Briefly describe the premise of your game to give potential players a sense of what it will be like to play.
* Sketch a flow chart of your game. What are the options the user can choose between, and where will those choices lead them?
### Rough draft (Wednesday, November 8, before class)
Write the code for the game. Make sure to meet all of the requirements.
### Colleague consultation (Wednesday, November 8, in class)
* Put your code on GitHub
* Get your partner's code from GitHub
* Check that your partner's code meets the requirements
* Make changes to your copy of your partner's code to make it better
### Presentation (Monday, November 13, in class)
Present your game for 4 minutes
* Introduce your game
* Do a play through where the class makes the choices
* Talk about any difficulties you had in making the game or parts you're especially proud of
* Answer questions
### Final draft (Wednesday, November 15)
Make any final changes to the game. Make sure to meet all of the requirements.
